When you need extra support, an outside perspective, or some expert guidance, talking to a therapist or counselor can help. While the support of friends and family is important, therapy is different. Therapists are professionally-trained listeners who can help you get to the root of your problems, overcome emotional challenges, and make positive changes in your life.",

Some also treat women using a holistic approach, or osteopathic perspective. This care often prioritizes natural or traditional remedies.
